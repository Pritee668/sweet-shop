# Sweet Shop Management System

## Overview

The Sweet Shop Management System is a full-stack application designed to manage sweets, allowing users to perform CRUD operations on sweet items. The project is structured into a backend API and a frontend application, both built using Node.js and TypeScript.

## Backend

The backend is built using Express and TypeScript. It provides RESTful API endpoints for managing sweets.

### Key Files

- **src/index.ts**: Entry point for the backend application.
- **src/app.ts**: Sets up middleware, routes, and error handling.
- **src/controllers/sweetsController.ts**: Handles API requests related to sweets.
- **src/services/sweetsService.ts**: Contains business logic for managing sweets.
- **src/models/sweet.ts**: Defines the structure of a sweet object.
- **src/routes/index.ts**: Sets up API routes.
- **src/types/index.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for request and response types.
- **tests/sweets.spec.ts**: Unit tests for the SweetsController and SweetsService.

## Frontend

The frontend is a single-page application (SPA) built with React and TypeScript. It interacts with the backend API to display and manage sweets.

### Key Files

- **src/index.tsx**: Entry point for the frontend application.
- **src/App.tsx**: Main application component.
- **src/components/SweetList.tsx**: Displays a list of sweets.
- **src/pages/Home.tsx**: Main page of the application.
- **src/types/index.ts**: TypeScript interfaces for frontend types.
- **tests/App.spec.tsx**: Unit tests for the App component.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `backend` directory and run `npm install` to install backend dependencies.
3. Navigate to the `frontend` directory and run `npm install` to install frontend dependencies.
4. Start the backend server by running `npm start` in the `backend` directory.
5. Start the frontend application by running `npm start` in the `frontend` directory.

## Objectives

- Implement a robust backend API for managing sweets.
- Create a user-friendly frontend application to interact with the API.
- Ensure code quality through unit testing and adherence to TypeScript standards.
